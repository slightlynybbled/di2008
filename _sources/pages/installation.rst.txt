Installation
==================================

The hardware drivers must be installed before this package may be utilized.  Hardware drivers may be downloaded from
the `manufacturer's product page <https://www.dataq.com/products/di-2008/>`_.

Once drivers are installed::

    $> pip install di2008

For the latest features, you may wish, instead, to clone the repository
`from the github page <https://github.com/slightlynybbled/di2008>`_ and run::

    $> python setup.py install
